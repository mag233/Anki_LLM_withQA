## FAQ

### Would the app work better if we use LangChain for RAG and chat? Is PyMuPDFLoader more suitable for PDF processing?

**Short answer:**  
Yes, using LangChain for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and chat can make your app more robust, modular, and easier to extend. For PDF processing, `PyMuPDFLoader` (from LangChain) is often more reliable and flexible than manual pdfplumber code.

**Why use LangChain for RAG and chat?**
- LangChain provides high-level abstractions for document loading, chunking, embedding, vector storage, retrieval, and conversational memory.
- You can easily swap out components (e.g., embedding model, retriever, LLM) without rewriting your pipeline.
- LangChain's `ConversationalRetrievalChain` and `ChatVectorDBChain` are designed for multi-turn, context-aware chat over your knowledge base.
- It supports advanced chunking (e.g., `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`), metadata handling, and prompt templates out of the box.

**Why use PyMuPDFLoader?**
- `PyMuPDFLoader` (LangChain) uses PyMuPDF (fitz) for PDF parsing, which is fast, robust, and handles a wide range of PDF layouts.
- It can extract text, metadata, and page structure more reliably than pdfplumber for many academic PDFs.
- Integrates seamlessly with LangChain's chunking and document pipeline.

**How to use in your pipeline?**
1. Install LangChain and PyMuPDF:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain pymupdf
   ```
2. Example: Load and chunk PDFs with LangChain
   ```python
   from langchain.document_loaders import PyMuPDFLoader
   from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

   loader = PyMuPDFLoader("your.pdf")
   docs = loader.load()
   splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=400, chunk_overlap=50)
   chunks = splitter.split_documents(docs)
   # Each chunk is a Document with .page_content and .metadata
   ```
3. Use LangChain's retriever and chat chain for RAG:
   ```python
   from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
   from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
   from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

   db = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, OpenAIEmbeddings())
   retriever = db.as_retriever()
   qa_chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
       llm=...,  # your LLM
       retriever=retriever,
   )
   # For chat: qa_chain({"question": user_input, "chat_history": history})
   ```

**Summary:**  
- LangChain + PyMuPDFLoader will make your RAG and chat pipeline more maintainable, scalable, and production-ready.
- You get better PDF parsing, chunking, and multi-turn chat with less custom code.
- Highly recommended for your use case.
